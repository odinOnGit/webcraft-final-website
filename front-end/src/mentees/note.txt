mentees components here

a file index.jsx must exist and must export App.jsx as default

index should look something like :
// mentees/Bob/index.jsx
import App from './App'

export const info = {
  title: 'Analog Clock',
  name: 'Bob',
  description: 'An analog clock built using React and CSS',
  image: '/assets/analog-clock.png'
}

export default App

after this is done, user has complete flexibility over file structure
